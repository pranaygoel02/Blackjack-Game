    <h3>Rules of the game:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Blackjack is a casino type game where players bet against the dealer for hands as close to 21 as possible without going over.</li>
        <li>Cards from 2-10 are worth their face value. Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 11 or 1 depending on which is more advantageous to the hand.</li>
        <li>At the beginning of the game, the dealer passes out one card face up to everyone including themselves. Next the dealer passes out one card face up to all of the players and one card face down for their own hand.</li>
        <li>If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer’s, you win. If your hand is equal to 21, it is called a “Blackjack”.</li>
        <li>If the dealer’s hand is closer to 21 than yours, you lose. If your hand becomes over 21 after a hit, it is called a “bust” and you automatically lose, regardless if the dealer also busts.</li>
        <p>Here the dealer is the computer itself.<p>
